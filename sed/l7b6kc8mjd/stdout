> This is a classic and hilarious example of a translation fail, often referred to as "Engrish."

> Rest assured, you are not eating a human organ. Here is what is likely happening:
> 
> **The Translation Error**
> The error likely stems from the double meaning of the word **"Appendix"**.
> 1.  **Anatomy:** The small organ attached to your intestine.
> 2.  **Book/Document:** A section at the end of a book containing **supplementary** or **additional** material.
> 
> The original text (likely Chinese, given the brand "Dr. Chu") probably used a word meaning **"Supplementary flavoring,"** **"Additional seasoning,"** or **"Side flavor."**
> 
> The translation software picked the wrong synonym for "supplement/addition"—choosing "Appendix" instead of "Added."
> 
> **The "Blindtarm" Confirmation**
> The best part of this label is the Danish/Norwegian translation below the English one: **"Blindtarmsmag."**
> *   *Blindtarm* is the literal medical term for the anatomical appendix.
> *   *Smag* means taste.
> 
> This proves that the translation software took the erroneous English word "Appendix" and translated it literally into Danish as the organ, resulting in "Appendix Taste."
> 
> **What is it actually?**
> Given that it is listed right before "flavor enhancer glutamic acid" (MSG), it is likely just referring to the **seasoning blend itself** or a **soup base** meant to be added to water.
> 
> Also, note the text above it: *"100% quality water without added aroma."* It seems the whole bag is a linguistic disaster!
