= Matters for Discussion

== 2025 Memberships
2025 memberships have now been retired as of the 14th.

== Club Event Applications
The 19th and 20th orientation week meetups have been booked along with week 1 and week 2 in Hobart. 

== Smaller Meeting Format
A smaller new meeting format will start to be used within the coming semester to try and cut down on meeting times and decrease response time to important items.

== Bank Signatories
The sinatories for the #PC's bank account have to be switched over which may only need #amari to attend as a new executive officer to sign on or require #cameron and #lachlan to also be present. This needs to be investigated.

TUSA has recently changed their address making our recent attempts to update to their previous address irrelevant. We now need to call an SGM to update our constitution and then inform CBA who will need to see the signed minutes for that event. We already have to do this with the 2025 AGM minutes to changing bank signatories so should try to do both at once.

== Beginner Tutorials
#cameron and #joshua have been working on the beginner tutorials to host at the start of semester to heopfully help out and draw in new students. The first one is almost complete, and there are 3 more waiting for steps to be written.
===
== New Logo
The club has decided to change logos and the winner will be voted on during the meeting.

== Club Activity Startup for 2026
The announcement has been made as of the 15th announcing our plans for the start of the year.

C&S booking has been confirmed and we now know where we are going to be required. 

== Club Account Handover
Club accounts still need to be handed over to new committee officers including changing all the passwords and removing access for old 2025 committee officers.

== ACS Funding
The #PC needs to enquire about the status of the potential ACS funding that #luke was in talks with them about.

== Competetive Programming Event
We are waiting on Lindsays response to helping run this event. If it goes through we agreed we would try and assist.

== Missing Club Chest
#joshua, #cameron and #amari have found the club chest items and they are currently stored at #joshua's house. We will have to find a more permanent place for it but not sure how hard that will be.

== Poster Advertisement for Orientation
We will be using a poster located near the exit of each venue for advertising the club during the ICT student orientation event. Hopefully this will give students more opportunity to access the clubs rubric and discord where we can get in contact while also reducing printing.

== Project Licensing
The terms and conditions of memberships was edited to remove the section related to club project code ownership: "Any contributions to projects run by the club are the property of the Programming Club". This is to ensure the club isn't making any legal claims to things it can't as we are still unsure over the logistics of code ownership seeing as we aren't incorperated in any way.

== Website Domain
We are unable to renew the current domain we hold (.com.au) as we are no longer going to be a business as per TUSA's rework on their clubs system. We are unsure as to what we will do when the domain expires.

== Small Items
- Both the current and new email forwarding systems have reported a number of failures recently with the new one failing for 2 days recently due to a malformed email.
- Late last year we were emailed by Linktree about changes to their Privacy Policy, since we don't use the account should we try to cancel it? At a minimum we should document how to access it.
- Google emailed us about changes to their date collection for Play, while no one should be using it, it is possible that they collect data from connected accounts if logged in on a phone so as much collection should be disabled as possible.
- We were recently emailed about Dream Big Australia's STEAM Ahead Program to help mentor women and non binary students on finding work after graduating, previous attempts to advertise have be made too late to be useful. Do we wish to advertise the program this year?
